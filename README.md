# Program Title (edit this)

Objective
Eight-ball is a pool billiards played on a billiard table with six pockets, cue sticks, and sixteen billiard balls: a cue ball and fifteen object balls. One player must pocket balls of the group numbered 1 through 7 (solid colors), while the other player has 9 through 15 (stripes). Each player is aiming to pocket his group first and then legally pocket the 8-ball to win the game.

Rules:
Before the game begins, the object balls should be placed in a triangular rack and positioned. The white ball should be placed anywhere behind the service line on the table.
The first player to pot an object ball will then have to continue to pot the balls from that category (stripes or solids). The opposition player will have to pot the other group. This step assigns each player their target balls (shown below the board).
A player will continue to make shots until they foul, or fail to pot an object ball. Then it is the turn of the opposing player. Play continues like this for the remainder of the game.
If a player commits a foul, the opposition player is entitled to place the cue ball anywhere on the table. There are numerous fouls in pool, some of the most common being failing to hit your own object balls or potting one of the opposition's object balls.
Once all of a playerâ€™s balls have been potted, they must then sink the 8 ball. They must first designate which pocket they intend to pot the 8-ball in and then do as stated. Failure to do so will result in the opposition player returning to the table. If the player pots the 8 ball in any other pocket other than the nominated one, they forfeit the game.

Moving the stick is done by dragging the mouse and clicking the screen finalizes the shot. Players are asked to indicate the power of their hit using the keyboard numbers 1 to 9.
